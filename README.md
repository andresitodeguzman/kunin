Parser tools and library for PHP ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

## ToDo
- [] Parse everything in the head (OpenGraph, Twitter & other meta-tags)
- [] Detect site main content

## What's with This?
Currently there is no straightforward solution to actually parse webpages ala-Facebook. Various functions and crazy libraries can be cumbersome for many. Project kunin may be unnecessary but it aims to be that one-solution for all. A library that is one call away.

## Now what?
Doing this is not an easy task. One solution can be better and more efficient than others. As needed, this would be improved in the future. It may be an internal tool for now, it may at lease serve some purpose for others.

## Docs?
This project is really meant for internal projects that requires to extract details from a webpage. Documentations would be made available in the future. The source code is already filled with comments so you don't have to actually need docs. Searching through the whole source code can be a pain though.

## Wanna Help?
This is open source so you can actually help me bring this thing to life. Issues will also be addressed. Yay. But this is an internal tool. You may use this but without warranty.
